### [Balanced Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/)

> Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced. <br/>
> For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

题目大意：判断给定二叉树是不是平衡二叉树
