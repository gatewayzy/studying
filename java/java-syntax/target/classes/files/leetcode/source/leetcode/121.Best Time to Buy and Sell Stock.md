### [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

> Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i. <br/>
> If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

题目大意：给定一个数组，代表股票每天的价格，假设至多只能买卖一次，找出最大利润

题目难度：Easy

```java
/**
 * Created by gzdaijie on 16/6/11
 * 每次更新最低价格 min，之后用 prices[i] - min 更新 result
 * 实质是寻找满足i > j的 prices[i] - prices[j] 的最大值
 */
public class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if (prices == null || prices.length < 2) return 0;
        
        int len = prices.length;
        int min = prices[0];
        int result = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < len; i++) {
            if (prices[i] <= min) min = prices[i];
            else result = Math.max(result, prices[i] - min);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
